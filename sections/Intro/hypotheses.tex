\subsection{Research Question and Hypotheses}
The question this project aims to answer is: \textbf{Can Deep Learning be used to learn the drift 
pattern to get drift free orientation estimation?} While this is the overarching question, it can be 
broken down to the following:
\begin{itemize}
  \item How effectively can deep learning learn the drift experienced?
  \item Can this model be generalised or will the model only apply to a single IMU?
  \item What are the advantages or disadvantages of using Deep Learning compared to traditional
    approaches? 
\end{itemize}
