\subsection{Magnetometer: Operations and Errors}
Magnetometers measure the local magnetic field along its orthogonal axes $m^x,m^y,m^z$. While the 
accelerometer can help in determining the inclination (roll/pitch), of an object, it cannot observe
any rotations along the gravity vector. This is where a magnetometer can be used to determine the 
heading (yaw) of an object. Sensor fusion/filtering algorithms are dependent on sensing the local
magnetic flied to eliminate drift in the azimuth (yaw) portion of orientation estimates \fixme{cite}.
It does this by assuming that the measured local field vector provides a reference 
relative to Earth's field, however changes in the local field due to other field sources, can 
distort this measurement and gives rise to erroneous heading corrections. 

\subsubsection{Magnetometer Error Sources and Effects}
\subsubsection*{Hard Iron/ Soft Iron}
Hard Iron is a constant additive magnetic field applied to the sensor 
due to the interaction of magnetic fields  \fixme{cite 2}. An 
example of this can be a permanent magnet near the magnetometer interacting with Earth's field.
This interaction between these sources leads to a constant vector being applied to the measurement.
Whilst this constant vector is easy to subtract in theory, it is very difficult to measure the Earth's
field ,in the local frame, without any interference of any kind.

Soft Iron are the effects generated by the interaction of an external magnetic field on any 
ferromagnetic materials near the sensor \fixme{cite 2}. The resulting magnetic field depends
on the magnetic field vector with respect to the orientation soft iron material \fixme{cite 3}. 
This effect is difficult to determine as if the orientation of the sensor changes, then the orientation
with respect to the soft iron also changes which distorts the field in a different way.

\subsubsection*{Noise}
As previously stated, in each sensor there is some noise that will either arise from flicker noise
or noise at higher frequencies which are modelled as white noise in nature. However, like the 
accelerometer, we do not need to do any type of integration which would lead to this noise giving
an unbounded drift. Therefore, even though it is an error source any hard/soft iron effects would
dominate any effect that noise would have on the system.
