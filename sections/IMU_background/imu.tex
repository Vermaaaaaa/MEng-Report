\section{IMU Basics and Operational Principles}
As mentioned before, IMUs consists of tri-axial gyroscope, accelerometer, and 
magnetometer. They measure angular rate, specific force, and the local magnetic
field vector. The sensors are mounted so that it measures their components
in the three orthorgonal axes $x^b,y^b,z^b$.
