\section*{Acknowledgements}
I would like to express my sincere gratitude to Dr. Zhiqiang Zhang for his continuous 
support and guidance throughout this project. Dr. Zhang's insights and advice during 
this project, in particular the quaternion algebra and an indepth explaination of filters 
were invaluable in shaping the direction of my work. In addition, offering his personal
copy of Body Sensor Networks to aid in my understanding is highly appreciated.

I would also like to acknowledge the authors and maintainers of the publicy available
datasets of BROAD and RepoIMU. Their efforts in collecting and labelling high quality
IMU data and optical motion capture ground truth enabled the training, testing, and 
validation of the neural network. I am grateful for their contributions and cite them
accordingly in this report.
