\section*{Abstract}
Inertial Measurement Units (IMUs) are widely used in a
variety of applications such as Body Sensor Networks (BSNs) for orientation
estimation, however they suffer from drift due to sensor bias and noise that 
when integrated accumulate over time. This \fixme{project} investigates a deep 
learning-based approach which aims to mitigate gyroscopic errors which can be 
integrated with sensor fusion techniques to achieve more accurate orientation 
estimates.
